# Discord bot made in discord.py

Welcome to the source code of my discord bot! Please don't

## Usage
- Install [Python 3.11.2](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.2/python-3.11.2-amd64.exe)

- Check the box which says "Add python.exe to PATH"

- After that open your favorite text editor and type "pip install requirements.txt"

- Create file called ".env" in the same directory as the main.py and add a variable called "token = (your bot token)", and in main.py you also want to rename "riku_token" to "token" or just leave it as it is and rename "token" to "riku_token" in .env file

- For weather you need your own api key which you can get from OpenWeatherMap
